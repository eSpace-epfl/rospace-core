# The Dzhanibekov Effect:
# ----------------------
# The Dzhanibekov effect, also known as the tennis racket theorem, describes a special form of rotation of a rigid
# body with three distinct principal moments of inertia. The effect shows that the rotation around the first and
# third principal axis is stable, whereas the rotation around the second is not. Due to this instability, a slight
# deviation of the rotation axis from the second principal axis results into flipping of the rotating object. The misalignment
# of the rotation axis can be caused by small disturbances (e.g. gravity gradient disturbance torque).
